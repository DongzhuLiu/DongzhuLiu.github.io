== About me 
I am currently a lecturer (analogous to assistant professor in the US) at [https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/systems-section/ System Section (GLASS), School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow].  I received the PhD degree from the University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of [https://www.eee.hku.hk/~wirelesslab// Prof. Kaibin Huang] in 2019, and the B.Eng. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2015. Prior to joining University of Glasgow, I was a postdoctoral research associate at the Department of Engineering, King's College London, working with [https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/osvaldo-simeone/ Prof. Osvaldo Simeone]. 


== Research Interests 
- Multimodal sensing in wireless networks 
- Scalable Bayesian learning and Bayesian optimization
- Integrated sensing, communication, and computation
- Edge AI
- Task-oriented communications 


*I am looking for PhD students who are self-motivated and have a strong background in machine learning, wireless communications, or signal processing. Feel free to contact me if you are interested.*
